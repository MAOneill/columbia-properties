# columbia-properties

A backend CMS (Content Management System) for a real estate management company.  I also redesigned their front-end websites to be mobile responsive.  Build using PostgreSQL, HTML, and CSS.

The inital version of the site was very difficult to use and not intuitive to update.  A custom backend was designed that took the users' exact needs and wants into consideration.  It adds a GUI system for placing locations on a map and custom, logical sorting controls.
